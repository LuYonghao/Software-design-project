# Software-design-project
This is the final Sofrware design project, wrote with language Effiel


NOTICE: This project is a course project and only public after the course is over. This is mean to be a proof of my learning result and design skills. 
I do not encourage plagiarism and reserve all copyright to myself.


Some instructions:

1. A project report that include design choice is in docs folder.

2. Regression-testing folder include ETF py file that can help with quick testing with large amount of test files.

3. The rest folders include the files that keep functionailty working.


How I test my code?

I write a java program to generate random test files (with amount and location of my choice), 
then use these files in regression-test to compare my result to the expected output
